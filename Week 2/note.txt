We tackle about linked list and there is three (3) types of it:
Singly - head and tails only, tail is NULL Value
Doubly - has previous node and the next node
Circular - the last node is linked to the first element or the head but the head previous value is NULL

Nodes - laman ay data and pointer used in linked list
pointer stores memory address of next node

head = node 1
tail = last node
